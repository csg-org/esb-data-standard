EAVS Section B Data Standard
============================
Welcome to the EAVS Section B Data Standard documentation. This data standard aims to provide a simple way
to provide data for Section B of the `Election Administration and Voting Survey`_, or EAVS. While the EAVS
collects data that allows for comparison of election administration at the state-level, the EAVS can tell
us very little about the voter-level transactions and what contributes to a voter successfully receiving
and casting a ballot. This standard gives states and jurisdictions a mechanism to provide data in a
structured format that allows for deeper analysis of voter behavior and isolate potential pitfalls in the
administrative process.
